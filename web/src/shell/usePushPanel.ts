/**
 * usePushPanel, the shared "settings slide-in that PUSHES content" behaviour.
 *
 * On desktop the panel docks to the right edge and the page content is shifted
 * left by the panel's width (an animated `padding-right` on the app shell root).
 * On mobile it becomes a bottom sheet and nothing is pushed. The chosen side is
 * LOCKED at open time so a mid-open viewport resize can't break the animation.
 *
 * Apps whose shell is CENTERED at a max width should pass `shellMaxWidth`: the
 * panel docks to the viewport's right edge, so on a wide monitor it may overlap
 * the centered shell only partially (or not at all). The shift then becomes just
 * that overlap instead of the full panel width — without it, opening the panel
 * squeezes the content against a band of dead space (bug class caught in
 * ccmanagerui 2026-07-10: Instances table crushed to half width by a 480px pad
 * while the panel overlapped the shell by ~30px).
 *
 * Usage (in an app shell):
 *   const open = ref(false);
 *   const { side, containerStyle } = usePushPanel(open, { shellMaxWidth: () => 1000 });
 *   // <div class="transition-[padding] duration-300 ease-in-out" :style="containerStyle"> ... </div>
 *   // <SettingsPanel v-model:open="open" :side="side"> ... </SettingsPanel>
