 * and the mini viewer would open huge from then on. Ask the daemon to open `/` as its
 * own portable window (its own slot, its own measured first-run size, its own
 * remembered geometry) and close this one. Only when that can't work — no Chromium to
 * spawn, or the daemon is unreachable — fall back to in-place navigation so the button
 * is never a dead end; a cramped dashboard still beats no dashboard.
 *
 * `opening` gates re-entry: the header button and the card's error badge both land
 * here, a forwarded --app launch opens a NEW window per invocation, and Chromium does
 * not fold duplicates — an unguarded double-click means two dashboards.
