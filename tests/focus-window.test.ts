// The desktop shortcut's focus window: its URL and its first-run size.
//
// Why this file exists: a shortcut promises "a small focused window showing just that
// server" (README/CHANGELOG). Two Chromium facts, both verified against Edge 150 on
// 2026-07-15, decide whether that promise can be kept:
//
//   1. A window Chromium has never seen opens at roughly the whole work area (~1905x2092
//      on a 4K display) unless --window-size says otherwise. So a size must be passed.
//   2. Chromium keys a saved app-window placement by host + PATH only — the query string
//      is not part of it. Under the old `/?process=<id>` URL every focus window and the
//      dashboard shared one `localhost_/` slot, so no focus window could hold its own
//      size and resizing one silently resized the others.
//
// Hence: the focus view lives at a PATH (one slot per process), and the size is first-run
// only (the kit's openPortableWindow yields to a placement the user's own resize saved).
// These tests pin the contract; the Chromium-side behavior is pinned in the kit's
// server-lib/portable-window.test.ts.
