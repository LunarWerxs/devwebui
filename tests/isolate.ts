// Import-time data-dir isolation — the CWD-proof half of the test isolation story.
//
// tests/setup.ts wires this in as a bunfig `preload`, which covers the common case:
// `bun test` launched from the repo root (where bunfig.toml is discovered). But bun
// resolves bunfig.toml RELATIVE TO THE CWD, so `bun test tests/foo.test.ts` launched
// from a PARENT or unrelated directory never loads the preload — and then any test that
// spins up a real Manager (or calls writeSettings/appendLog/…) persists logs, error
// records and settings into the LIVE ~/.devwebui. That leak flipped the real machine's
// settings and put a phantom "N errors" count in the GUI (see the fixture logs that piled
// up under ~/.devwebui/logs across days of runs before this existed).
//
// Importing this module FIRST in such a test guarantees DEVWEBUI_HOME points at a
// throwaway dir no matter how the runner was invoked: dataDir() reads the env lazily at
// write time (long after imports run), so setting it during this module's evaluation is
// always early enough. Idempotent + module-cached: it fires once per process, and defers
// to a DEVWEBUI_HOME the caller (or the preload) already set.

// by age (below) reclaims leftovers WITHOUT ever deleting a concurrent run's active dir —
// preserving the "never delete a sibling's dir" safety the preload's cleanup relies on. That
