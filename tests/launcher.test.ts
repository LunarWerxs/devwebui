// Hardcore guard for the one-click launcher. The promise to a user is: there is
// ALWAYS a clickable shortcut in the project root that, when run, boots the daemon
// and shows the tray icon. These tests fail LOUD ("thou shalt not pass") the moment
// any link in that chain is missing, uncommitted, mis-wired, or the icon is broken.
//
// The chain:  DevWebUI.lnk (root)  →  wscript  →  misc/Tray-Launch.vbs (shared,
//             auto-discovering launcher)  →  misc/DevWebUI-Tray.ps1 (adapter)  →
//             misc/Tray-Host.ps1 (shared engine)  →  bun server/src/index.ts
//             +  misc/DevWebUI.ico
//
// DevWebUI-Tray.ps1 is now a THIN ADAPTER over the shared LunarWerx tray-host engine
// (misc/Tray-Host.ps1, kit-synced from lunarwerx-ui — never edited inside this repo).
// The old per-app misc/DevWebUI.vbs is GONE, replaced by the shared, zero-config
// misc/Tray-Launch.vbs (also kit-synced), which auto-discovers the sibling
// "*-Tray.ps1" adapter instead of hard-coding its name. misc/Create-Shortcut.ps1 is
// likewise now a THIN ADAPTER over the shared misc/New-TrayShortcut.ps1 engine
// (kit-synced), supplying only DevWebUI's name / icon / description. Assertions here
// are split accordingly:
//   - ENGINE-INVARIANT tray-host behavior (mutex-before-icon, icon-always-created-
//     then-gated, loser-branch-creates-no-icon, portable-window open path,
//     hideTrayIcon live-sync, generic health-probe shape) is asserted against
//     misc/Tray-Host.ps1, since that's the file that actually implements it, and it
//     must carry the kit-synced header because it must NEVER be edited by hand
//     inside this repo.
//   - SHARED LAUNCHER/SHORTCUT machinery (Tray-Launch.vbs's auto-discovery,
//     New-TrayShortcut.ps1's shortcut-building) is asserted to carry the kit-synced
//     header and to be dot-sourced / delegated to by this app's thin adapters,
//     never reimplemented locally.
//   - APP-SPECIFIC config (mutex literal, daemon start command, icon filename, shutdown
//     token env var + header prefix, sentinel path convention, menu label, self-test
//     marker) is asserted against misc/DevWebUI-Tray.ps1, since that's what this repo
//     actually owns and can drift.
//   - Live end-to-end proofs (-SelfTest subprocess, Create-Shortcut.ps1 + resolving the
//     real .lnk) keep exercising the adapter exactly as before — those are the ONLY
//     assertions that prove the whole chain actually runs, not just that the right
//     strings exist somewhere.
//
// The .lnk itself is gitignored (it stores absolute, per-machine paths), so the
// guarantee is enforced via the COMMITTED machinery that regenerates it
// (Create-Shortcut.ps1) — and, on Windows, by actually regenerating + resolving it
// and by running the tray's headless self-test.
