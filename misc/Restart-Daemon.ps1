# misc/Restart-Daemon.ps1 — kill this app's daemon AND its tray host, no exceptions, then relaunch.
#
# CONTRACT (owner directive, 2026-07-15): a rebuild must NEVER leave you on old code.
# If something of OURS is running, it dies. There is no "left alone", no advisory note,
# no polite skip. The ONLY thing this script won't kill is a process that isn't ours --
# and "is it ours" is now a question with a hard answer instead of a guess.
#
# WHY THE OLD VERSION FAILED (2026-07-15):
# It probed every bun/node listener's /api/health and treated a body with no `service`
# field as "unidentified -> leave it alone". Three Connections Vite DEV SERVERS (ports
# 4180/4204/4273) answer /api/health with 200 OK and an index.html body, because Vite
# serves the SPA fallback for every unknown path. They therefore looked exactly like "a
# daemon that won't say who it is", and the script printed a note asking us to add a
# `service` field to an app (redesign) that has had one all along.
#
# Wait-Daemon.ps1 had the mirror-image bug, and it was the worse of the two: it ACCEPTED
# an unidentified responder as this app (`if (-not $svc -or $svc -eq $AppName)`), latched
# onto one of those Vite servers, read that stranger's start time, and announced
# "STALE DAEMON: you are still being served the OLD code" -- about a daemon that had in
# fact just restarted perfectly. A false alarm isn't harmless: it sends you hunting a bug
# that doesn't exist, and it teaches you to ignore the alarm on the day it's real.
#
# THE IDENTITY RULE (fixes both directions):
# A listener is OURS only if /api/health returns Content-Type `application/json` AND a
# body with `ok: true` AND `service` equal to this app's package.json `name`. Absence of
# identity is never identity; HTML is never identity. That one rule makes the sweep both
# ruthless (anything that IS us dies, including an orphan the pointer forgot) and safe (a
# Vite dev server, a sibling app, or any unrelated node process can never match).
#
# WHY THE OLD TRAY HOST DIES TOO (2026-07-15, the zero-instance incident):
# This script used to kill only the daemon and then fire the app shortcut. But taskkill /T
# kills a tree DOWNWARD from the daemon -- never its PARENT, the hidden powershell running
# "<App>-Tray.ps1". That old tray host survived, its ~5s watchdog revived a daemon of its
# own, and the shortcut launch raced it with a SECOND tray host. The loser of that mutex
# race blocks forever on an "already starting" MessageBox nobody will ever dismiss (a
# zombie whose open handle also keeps the named mutex alive, poisoning every later launch
# into the loser path). Observed end state: within ~90 seconds the daemon, BOTH tray
# hosts, and everything else were gone -- zero instances, nothing left to revive anything.
# So tray hosts are first-class kill targets now, found by the app's unique "<App>-Tray.ps1"
# adapter filename in powershell/pwsh command lines, and they die in the same sweep BEFORE
# the daemons so no watchdog can fight the restart. Tree-killing a tray host usually reaps
# its cmd->bun daemon in the same stroke; the identity sweep still catches adopted strays,
# orphans, and headless daemons.
#
# WHY THE RELAUNCH GOES THROUGH WMI:
# Start-Process parents the new tray host under THIS console's process tree, so closing the
# terminal (or the tool/job that ran the rebuild) can tear the whole app down minutes later
# -- silent, nothing in the daemon log, exactly the hard-kill signature of the incident's
# endgame. Win32_Process.Create parents it to WmiPrvSE instead, outside this tree and job
# (the same isolation trick ccmanagerui uses to keep dispatch supervisors alive across a
# daemon restart), so the app outlives whatever ran this script.
#
# WHY WE ONLY KILL PROCESSES OLDER THAN THIS RUN:
# Kill targets are restricted to processes that started BEFORE this script did. A daemon or
# tray host younger than our start stamp is the fresh build arriving -- our own relaunch
# below, or a dying watchdog getting one last spawn in -- not a survivor. Sparing it is
# also what makes the verify loop terminate instead of fighting a fresh replacement
# forever. Wait-Daemon.ps1 reads the same stamp to prove the daemon that ends up answering
# is younger than the restart, i.e. that it really is a new process.
#
# App-agnostic on purpose: everything derives from package.json `name` and the sibling
# "*-Tray.ps1" adapter, so the same file works in ccmanagerui / redesign / repoyeti /
# devwebui. Keep the four copies identical.
