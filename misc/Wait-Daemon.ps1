# misc/Wait-Daemon.ps1 — confirm the daemon came back, PROVE it serves the code we just built,
# and PROVE it stays up.
#
# WHY: the failure this guards against is silent. On 2026-07-14 a daemon served 10h39m-old code
# while every `Rebuild.bat` run printed "Done." The build was genuinely fresh on disk; the process
# serving it simply never restarted. Nothing in the flow ever looked, so nothing ever complained.
#
# So a rebuild is not "done" when the script ends. It is done when a daemon answers /api/health as
# THIS app AND that process started AFTER we stopped the old one AND it is still that same process,
# still answering, a stability hold later. Each clause earned its place the hard way:
#   * merely UP proves nothing -- the stale daemon was up the entire time too (2026-07-14);
#   * answering ONCE proves liveness, not stability -- on 2026-07-15 this script printed "OK" one
#     second after boot, and within ~90 seconds the daemon, two fighting tray hosts, and everything
#     else were dead (the zero-instance incident; see Restart-Daemon.ps1's header). A supervisor
#     race or a console teardown kills AFTER first health, so the hold is where it gets caught.
#
# HOW THIS SCRIPT ITSELF LIED (2026-07-15), and the rule that fixes it:
# The old Find-Daemon accepted any responder that didn't contradict us --
#   if (-not $svc -or $svc -eq $AppName) { return ... }
# -- so a health body with no `service` field counted as this app. Vite dev servers answer
# /api/health with the SPA fallback (200 OK, text/html, an index.html body), so one of Michael's
# Connections dev planes on port 4273 was mistaken for redesign; this script read THAT stranger's
# start time, found it older than the stamp, and reported "STALE DAEMON: you are still being served
# the OLD code" while the real redesign daemon was up on port 5178 serving the fresh build.
#
# The rule now matches Restart-Daemon.ps1 exactly: a responder is this app only with a JSON
# content-type, `ok: true`, and `service` EQUAL to package.json `name`. Silence is not identity.
# An unidentified responder is a stranger, so we keep looking rather than latch onto it and lie in
# either direction (a false "stale" is as costly as a false "fresh" -- it burns your time hunting a
# bug that doesn't exist, and it trains you to ignore the alarm on the day it's real).
#
# How it knows when the rebuild started: Restart-Daemon.ps1 drops a timestamp file when it runs.
# If that stamp is present and recent, the daemon must be younger than it. If there is no stamp
# (someone ran this script on its own), there is nothing to compare against, so this degrades to a
# plain "is it up (and does it stay up)?" check rather than inventing a threshold and crying wolf.
