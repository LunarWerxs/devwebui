# DevWebUI system-tray host (Windows). Thin adapter over the shared Tray-Host engine
# (misc/Tray-Host.ps1). This file owns only what's genuinely app-specific: names,
# paths, the daemon start command, and a few documented behavior tweaks. Everything
# else -- mutex/tray lifecycle, watchdog, rebuild/restart worker, hide-tray live-sync,
# open path, full-shutdown sentinel -- lives in the shared engine.
#
# Launch it via Tray-Launch.vbs (which auto-discovers the sibling *-Tray.ps1 and runs it
# hidden) so there's no console flash; the port comes from this file's own param() default,
# not the .vbs. The daemon serves the built GUI + API on one port. The shortcut launches
# FAST with the existing build; use the tray's "Rebuild & Restart" to rebuild from source.
