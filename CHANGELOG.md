# Changelog

All notable changes to DevWebUI are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-13

### Changed
- **Brand tray/taskbar icon regenerated** from the current stacked-servers vector (the shipped
  `misc/DevWebUI.ico` had drifted to a generic placeholder). A new `misc/Make-Icon.ps1` rebuilds
  it from the committed `misc/DevWebUI-icon.png` master (re-rendered from `web/public/icon.svg`),
  matching the sibling apps' icon-generator convention; the web `favicon.ico` was refreshed too.
- **Settings split into tabs.** The settings panel now groups its sections under three tabs
  (General / Servers / Projects) instead of one long scroll, using the shared kit's new
  segmented tab bar. General holds appearance, app updates, resource monitoring, and cloud
  sync; Servers holds the start-behavior knobs plus the portable-window / link-host group;
  Projects holds scanning. Save/Cancel stay visible on every tab and still apply the whole
  form at once.

### Added
- **Linked servers.** Two new optional per-process fields in the `.devwebui` schema. `links` names
  sibling process ids that act as one unit: the relationship is symmetric and transitive, so
  starting or stopping any member of a linked group (GUI single-process actions, or MCP
  `start_process` / `stop_process`) starts or stops the whole group. `companion: true` marks a
  process (a shared database or proxy, say) that starts whenever any other process in the project
  is started individually; companions are never stopped by group propagation. Neither affects
  autostart, "start project"/"start all", or restart. Both live in the process edit dialog (a
  linked-servers picker and a Companion toggle), and persist in the `.devwebui` file. When an
  action ripples to other servers, the GUI shows an "Also started/stopped: …" toast, and the
  HTTP/MCP response lists the affected ids (`coStarted` / `coStopped`).
- **Portable window mode.** A new Settings → Open in browser → "Portable window" toggle opens
  DevWebUI in its own chromeless Chromium app window (`msedge`/`chrome --app=`, no tabs or
  address bar) instead of a normal browser tab. Turning it on immediately opens the app window
  (`POST /api/portable-window`); the desktop launcher/tray follows the same setting on its next
  Open/double-click/launch, falling back to a normal tab when no Edge or Chrome is installed.
  The window uses a dedicated Chromium profile (`~/.devwebui/portable-profile`) shared by both
  open paths, so it remembers its own size and position across launches instead of sharing the
  main browser profile.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-09

Release-readiness audit: makes a public `bun install` (no private LunarWerx registry access)
boot cleanly, clarifies what "Sign in with Connections" actually does, and cleans up some
internal duplication. No new network calls or install IDs.

### Changed
- **Sign in with Connections now uses the official `@cnct/connect` / `@cnct/locker` SDKs**
  instead of a hand-rolled client. Both are optional dependencies that are only ever loaded
  (via dynamic `import()`) when you actually use sign-in — so installing DevWebUI without
  access to the private LunarWerx package registry still boots the daemon cleanly; sign-in
  simply reports itself unavailable instead of crashing anything.
- Existing sign-ins are migrated to the new SDK's token storage automatically on first boot
  after upgrading — no need to sign in again. "Forget" now also revokes the credential with
  the server, not just locally.
- **README clarifies the one optional, off-by-default thing that ever touches the network:**
  settings sync, which requires explicitly signing in with a Connections account.
- **README rewritten for humans**, with real screenshots (dashboard, live logs, de-duplicated
  error log, light theme) and a release badge; the full 17-tool MCP list moved to `AI_GUIDE.md`.
- **Release notes come from the CHANGELOG** (the tagged version's section) rather than an
  auto-generated commit list; dropped a redundant `bun install` in `release.yml`.
- The `bun` workspace was internally renamed from `devdeck` to `devwebui` to match the
  product name (no user-visible effect).

### Fixed
- `/oauth/login` now redirects back to the app with an error instead of returning a server
  error (HTTP 500) when the sign-in machinery isn't available.
- **CI is green again.** `bun run lint` (Biome) had been failing on pre-existing format drift plus
  two `noExplicitAny` warnings in `tests/auto-update.test.ts` (the fixtures are now typed as
  `UpdateStatus` / `UpdateApplyResult`). Bumped `actions/cache` + `actions/checkout` to clear the
  Node.js 20 deprecation warning, and fixed the `release.yml` "stage binary" step that failed on
  Linux/macOS (`ls` of a per-OS path under `set -e -o pipefail`).

### Internal
- De-duplicated several bits of internal logic that had drifted into multiple copies: the
  helper that captures a spawned process's stdout, the shared log-line cap constant, the
  error-event type, and the file-store path normalizer.
- The settings sync UI now cleans up its background refresh timer when it's closed, and the
  in-memory log buffer trims old lines more efficiently (O(1) instead of shifting an array).
- Removed lingering references to the private internal kit-repo name from source comments.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-06

First public, open-source release.

### Added
- **`devwebui` CLI.** A single installable command (new `bin`) so humans, scripts, and AI agents
  can run and drive DevWebUI without `bun run <script>` or raw HTTP/MCP: `devwebui start`
  (boots the daemon detached and prints the URL; `--foreground` runs it attached, `--port N`
  pins the port), `devwebui stop` (graceful shutdown), `devwebui status [--json]` (running? where?
  + a project/process summary), `devwebui list`/`ps` (managed processes), `devwebui start-process` /
  `stop-process` / `restart-process` / `enable-process` / `disable-process <id|name>`,
  `devwebui start-all` / `stop-all`, and `devwebui mcp` (the stdio MCP server). It's a thin wrapper
  over the daemon's existing REST API + `instance.ts` discovery (`shared/routes.ts`) — no new
  control logic. Lives in `server/src/cli.ts`.
- **Open a dev server from its title.** Click a running process's name (card or table
  view) to open it in a new browser tab. By default it opens the port-derived
  `http://<host>:<port>` (the host is configurable — see below); a new optional per-process
  `url` field overrides it — an absolute `http(s)://…` opens verbatim, or a path like
  `/admin` is appended to that address. The title is only a link while the process is
  running, and `url` is editable from the Add/Edit process form.
- **Configurable link host** (Settings → *Open in browser*, persisted as `linkHost`). By
  default a process opens on the host you're viewing DevWebUI from (so `localhost` on your
  own machine, the LAN IP from another device); set an explicit host to pin it, e.g. a fixed
  dev-box hostname. A per-process absolute `url` still overrides the host entirely.
- **Server-owned scan presets** (`startup` / `quick` / `deep` / `scoped`) — call sites
  ask for an intent instead of repeating raw depth/budget/limit numbers.
- **Internationalization (i18n).** The web UI is now fully localized with
  [vue-i18n](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/). English is the base catalog
  (`web/src/i18n/locales/en.ts`); every user-facing string — including
  accessibility labels, placeholders, and tooltips — is routed through `t()` /
  `<i18n-t>`. See `web/src/i18n/README.md`.
- **Language picker** in Settings → *Language* — driven by the locale registry and
  persisting the choice. It stays hidden while English is the only registered locale,
  so it appears automatically the moment a second language is added.
- **i18n compliance checker** (`bun run check:i18n`, also gates `bun run build`).
  Fails the build on any hardcoded UI string, any `t()` key missing from the base
  catalog, or any locale that drifts from the English key shape.
- **Sponsor credit** — a subtle footer line crediting
  [LunarWerx Studios](https://lunarwerx.com/).
- **MIT `LICENSE`** — DevWebUI is now open source.
- **Launcher guard tests** (`tests/launcher.test.ts`, via `bun test`) — fail unless the
  one-click launcher is intact: the shortcut machinery (`Create-Shortcut.ps1`,
  `DevWebUI.vbs`, `DevWebUI-Tray.ps1`, `DevWebUI.ico`) exists, is committed, and is wired
  shortcut → wscript → vbs → tray → daemon + icon. On Windows it also runs the tray's new
  headless `-SelfTest` (bun on PATH + daemon entry + the icon actually loading into a
  `NotifyIcon`) and regenerates + resolves the root shortcut.

### Changed
- **Single instance.** Only one DevWebUI daemon runs at a time. On launch it checks the
  runtime pointer (validated with an `/api/health` probe) and, if a daemon is already
  serving, prints where it's running and exits instead of starting a second one — across
  every entry point (tray, `bun run daemon`, `bun start`, `bun run dev`). A `--watch`
  reload of the dev daemon is exempt so hot-reload still rebinds cleanly.
- **Daemon survives a busy port.** On launch the daemon prefers its configured port but,
  if it's taken, steps to the next free one instead of crashing on bind — the same
  courtesy it already gives the dev servers it manages. The port it actually bound is
  written to `~/.devwebui/runtime.json`; the tray launcher reads that (validated with an
  `/api/health` probe) to open the right URL and to detect an already-running instance,
  `bun run dev` reserves the port up front so the Vite proxy follows the daemon, and the
  MCP client falls back to that pointer so agents reach a hopped daemon without any manual
  `DEVWEBUI_URL`.
- **Scan notifications say what they found.** The "found new projects" notification now
  lists each project (name, path, process count) instead of just a bare count, and
  **"Review & add" no longer clears it** — a scan notification is removed only when you
  explicitly Dismiss or Clear it, so a mis-click never loses the find.
- **Shared contract (`shared/`).** Cross-boundary DTOs, REST route definitions, daemon
  constants, and the `.devwebui` Zod schema now live in one `shared/` module that the
  daemon, the MCP client, and the web GUI all import — so types, routes, and the file
  schema can no longer drift between surfaces. The schema is the single source of truth
  (the web infers its types from it; zod stays out of the browser bundle).
- **Async, package-backed detection.** Project-scaffold detection moved off the HTTP
  hot path (async `fs/promises`, no event-loop-blocking tree walk), and the bespoke
  workspace-glob / package-manager / pnpm-yaml parsing was replaced with `tinyglobby`,
  `package-manager-detector`, and `yaml`.
- **Tidier HTTP layer.** Repeated request-body parsing, error responses, and
  project-lookup checks in the daemon's routes were factored into small shared helpers
  (identical responses, less boilerplate).
- **Safer "Free port".** Freeing a process's port now stops a DevWebUI-managed holder
  cleanly and, for *external* processes, reports the owner (PID + name) and asks for
  explicit confirmation before killing only those PIDs — instead of blindly killing
  whatever held the port.
- **Log backpressure.** The daemon coalesces child output into batched SSE `log` events
  (and sheds the oldest under a flood) rather than fanning out one event per line.
- **Robust machine scans.** Scans are single-flighted and serialized (no overlapping
  broad-scan storms) and abort when the requesting client disconnects.
- **Hardened subprocess helpers.** Git clone and the native file/folder pickers now have
  timeouts, honour request-abort, bound their captured output, and clean up the partial
  folder a failed/aborted clone leaves behind.
- **Centralized daemon defaults.** The daemon port, MCP base URL, and log-buffer cap live
  in one place (`server/src/constants.ts`); the Vite proxy follows `DEVWEBUI_PORT`.
- **Header redesign.** The live/offline indicator moved to the left beside the
  logo and merged with the active-server count (`● Live · N of M active`).
- The card/table view switch and the sort & filter controls moved into the
  header's "⋮" overflow menu — view is a single split control (Cards | Table) and
  filters open in a focused modal.

### Fixed
- **CPU/memory now reflect the whole server, not its shell wrapper.** Managed
  processes are spawned with `shell: true`, so the pid we hold is the OS shell
  (cmd.exe on Windows), not the real Node/Bun server — which lives in a child. The
  sampler used to read only that wrapper, reporting ~8 MB and ~0% CPU for a server
  actually using 50–200 MB. It now sums the entire descendant process tree
  (`metrics.ts`): on Windows via an in-process `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` (still no
  spawning), and on the `pidusage` fallback by expanding the subtree first. Covered
  by `tests/metrics.test.ts`.

### Internal
- **End-to-end type checking** — `bun run typecheck` runs `vue-tsc` over the web app
  and `tsc` over the server (previously only the web build was type-checked).
- **Biome** for linting + formatting (`bun run lint` / `bun run format`), tuned to the
  existing style; `.vue` template-blind rules, the generated `ui/` primitives, and
  static assets are scoped out.
- **Expanded unit tests** — pure logic for the link/URL builder, process sort/filter,
  port helpers, and the `.devwebui` schema (`bun test`, 13 → 34 tests).
- **CI** — a GitHub Actions workflow runs install, lint, typecheck, build, and tests on
  every push to `main` and every pull request.
- **Smaller modules** — the log-backpressure batcher (`log-buffer.ts`) and the
  `ProcessView` projection (`process-view.ts`) were split out of `manager.ts`, and the
  drag-drop helpers (`lib/drop.ts`) out of the Add-Project dialog.
- **Dependencies refreshed to latest** — Vite 8, TypeScript 6, vue-tsc 3,
  `@vitejs/plugin-vue` 6, concurrently 10, `@types/node` 26, plus assorted minors;
  CI's `actions/checkout` bumped to v5 (clears the Node 20 deprecation). `baseUrl` was
  dropped from the web tsconfigs (deprecated in TS 6; `paths` resolves without it).
  `zod` is intentionally held at 3.x — `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` is not yet
  zod-4 compatible, so bumping it would break the MCP server.
