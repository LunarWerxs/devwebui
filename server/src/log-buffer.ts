 * Live-log backpressure. Child output is queued and flushed in coalesced batches so
 * a noisy process can't fan out one SSE write per line to every connected client.
 * Under a sustained flood the buffer sheds its oldest line (the per-process REST ring
 * still keeps the full history); a single armed timer batches everything in its window.
 *
 * `pending` is a fixed-capacity ring (head + count), not a plain array: shedding the
 * oldest line under flood used to be an `Array.shift()` per push — an O(n) copy of
 * every remaining element, per line, once the cap is hit. The ring drops the oldest
 * slot in O(1) by just advancing `head` and letting the write wrap around.
