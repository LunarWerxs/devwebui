// Live `.devwebui` reloading — the daemon re-reads a project's file when it changes
// on disk, so an edit shows up in the GUI without restarting anything.
//
// The gap this closes: `readDevWebUIFile()` ran EXACTLY ONCE per project — the boot
// loop in index.ts, or a GUI/MCP load. The daemon is long-lived, so after that first
// parse the file on disk and the daemon's picture of it drifted apart silently. Edit
// `.devwebui` in an editor, reload the GUI, and you'd still see the OLD process list:
// the frontend faithfully rendered what the daemon held, and the daemon had never
// looked at the file again. (Found 2026-07-16: five servers added to a repo's
// `.devwebui` were invisible in the GUI until the daemon restarted. Reloading the
// browser cannot help — the staleness is server-side.)
//
// Reconciliation is NOT re-implemented here: `Manager.reconcileProject()` already
// applies a re-read the right way — it adds new processes, drops removed ones, and
// PRESERVES the running state of everything unchanged, restarting only a process whose
// exec shape (command/cwd/runtime/env) actually moved. This module's whole job is to
// notice the write and call it. That is why auto-reload is safe: editing a file to add
// a server never disturbs the servers already running.
//
// Five things it has to get right, each of which breaks a naive `watch(file)`:
//
//   1. WATCH THE DIRECTORY, NOT THE FILE. Editors (and `git checkout`, and any
//      write-temp-then-rename) save ATOMICALLY: the original inode is replaced, not
//      appended to. A file-level watch is bound to the old inode and goes permanently
//      deaf after the first such save — it would work once in testing and never again
//      in real use. A non-recursive directory watch keeps firing across replacements.
//   2. DEBOUNCE. One save emits several events (rename + change, or chunked writes).
//      Reconciling per event does the work N times and can restart a server mid-write.
//   3. NEVER TRUST A PARTIAL READ. A file caught mid-write parses as invalid JSON, and
//      an atomic rename leaves a window where the path briefly does not exist at all.
//      Both throw, and both are TRANSIENT — so a failed read is skipped and left for
//      the next event, never allowed to drop the project. A project vanishing from the
//      GUI because it was read 3ms too early would be a far worse bug than staleness.
//   4. IGNORE NO-OP WRITES. Compared against the last text we successfully applied, so
//      a touch, a formatter rewrite, or the daemon's OWN writes (the GUI/MCP edit
//      routes write the file, then reconcile it themselves) don't reconcile twice.
//      Belt-and-braces: reconcileProject is idempotent, so the duplicate would be
//      harmless anyway — by the time our event lands, the route has already applied
//      the same def and `execChanged` is false, so nothing restarts.
//   5. TREAT THE EVENT'S FILENAME AS ADVISORY. It is the least portable part of
//      fs.watch. For an atomic save, Windows reports both the old and the new name, so
//      the destination `.devwebui` shows up; Linux and macOS report the event against
//      the TEMP file, or omit the name entirely, and never name the destination. Keying
//      the re-check off that name therefore missed precisely the save style rule 1
//      exists to survive, and it did so on 2 of the 3 platforms we ship (caught by CI
//      2026-07-18, after a Windows-only local run passed). So the name is ignored: any
//      event in a watched dir re-checks that dir's watched files. A spurious check
//      costs one small read and changes nothing, because rule 4 byte-compares before
//      doing any work, and rule 2 coalesces a burst into a single check.
//
// The watch set self-syncs off the manager's "projects" event — the same signal the
// GUI listens to — so loading or removing a project adjusts the watchers with no call
// sites to keep in step.

// Long enough to coalesce an editor's multi-event save, short enough to feel instant.

// being too high is the GUI feeling laggy after a save.
