/**
 * Shared "portable window" opener for the LunarWerx daemons. Opens the app's UI in a
 * chromeless Chromium app window (`msedge --app=URL`, falling back to Chrome) so the
 * app presents as its own desktop window instead of a browser tab. Each app exposes
 * this through a POST /api/portable-window route; the tray launchers implement the
 * same resolve-and-fallback chain in PowerShell for cold starts (before the daemon,
 * and therefore this lib, is running).
 *
 * The window is a real, separate OS browser process: spawned detached and unref()ed,
 * so it never ties its lifetime to the daemon (an auto-update relaunch of the daemon
 * leaves the window up; its SSE reconnects once the successor rebinds the port).
 *
 * Runtime-agnostic (Bun + Node). Synced from the shared kit, do not edit in an
 * app; the `.d.mts` sibling types the import for the TypeScript apps.

 * fighting over) the user's main browser profile; it also runs as its own browser
 * process rather than handing off to an already-running instance. The family convention
 * is `<configDir>/portable-profile` (a sibling of runtime.json), and the PS tray
 * launchers derive the exact same path so both open paths share one profile. A dir that
 * cannot be created falls back to the default profile rather than failing the open.
