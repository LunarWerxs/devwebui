/**
 * Shared "portable window" opener for the LunarWerx daemons. Opens the app's UI in a
 * chromeless Chromium app window (`msedge --app=URL`, falling back to Chrome) so the
 * app presents as its own desktop window instead of a browser tab. Each app exposes
 * this through a POST /api/portable-window route; the tray launchers implement the
 * same resolve-and-fallback chain in PowerShell for cold starts (before the daemon,
 * and therefore this lib, is running).
 *
 * The window is a real, separate OS browser process that must OUTLIVE this daemon: an
 * auto-update relaunch of the daemon (or a tray Quit) must leave the window up, and its
 * SSE reconnects once the successor rebinds the port. The daemon's tray Quits by force
 * tree-killing the daemon (`taskkill /PID <daemon> /T /F`), and an auto-update relaunch
 * kills+respawns it the same way, so the window must NOT be a descendant of the daemon.
 * On Windows neither `.unref()` nor `detached:true` removes a child from the parent's
 * process tree (verified 2026-07-12), so the launch goes through a `cmd /c start ""`
 * hand-off (buildPortableSpawn) that re-parents the browser out of the tree; POSIX uses
 * `detached:true` (a real setsid detach).
 *
 * Runtime-agnostic (Bun + Node). Synced from the shared kit, do not edit in an
 * app; the `.d.mts` sibling types the import for the TypeScript apps.

 * Best-effort by design: callers surface the failure to the user (toast / fallback to
 * a normal tab) rather than treating it as fatal.
 *
 * `opts.profileDir` gives the window a dedicated Chromium profile (`--user-data-dir`).
 * Chromium remembers app-window size/position PER PROFILE, so a dedicated profile means
 * the portable window keeps its own geometry across launches instead of inheriting (and
 * fighting over) the user's main browser profile; it also runs as its own browser
 * process rather than handing off to an already-running instance. The family convention
 * is `<configDir>/portable-profile` (a sibling of runtime.json), and the PS tray
 * launchers derive the exact same path so both open paths share one profile. A dir that
 * cannot be created falls back to the default profile rather than failing the open.
 *
 * `opts.initialSize` ({ width, height }) is the size to open a window Chromium has NEVER
 * seen — the first-run geometry. It is deliberately not applied once the user has sized
 * the window themselves ({@link hasRememberedBounds}), because `--window-size` overrides
 * a restored placement and would silently undo their resize on every launch. Omit it to
 * accept Chromium's own default, which is roughly the whole work area — far too big for
 * a small single-purpose window, which is the reason this option exists.
